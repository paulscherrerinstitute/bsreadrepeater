# BSREAD repeater

Receive from configured sources and replay all messages on the configured output sockets.
A single source can be replayed on multiple outputs.
Input sources and output sockets can be added and removed at runtime.


# Binaries for RHEL 7

https://data-api.psi.ch/distri/bsrep-amd64-rhel7.tgz


# Run the application

Start via the shell wrapper to use the packaged libzmq:

```
path/to/bsrep.sh <CMDADDR> [CMDFILE]
```

Configuration is done by sending zmq messages to the command socket.
The command socket is a REP socket on `CMDADDR`.

An optional `CMDFILE` can be specified and those commands are applied at start.
The command file contains one command per line.
Example command file:
```
add-source,tcp://source.psi.ch:9900
add-output,tcp://source.psi.ch:9900,tcp://0.0.0.0:4000
add-output,tcp://source.psi.ch:9900,tcp://0.0.0.0:4001
add-source,tcp://source.psi.ch:9901
add-output,tcp://source.psi.ch:9901,tcp://0.0.0.0:4002
```
For a realistic number of sources, the command file is meant to be
generated by tooling, not by hand.


# Commands

All commands are accessible by sending a zmq message to the `REP` socket at `CMDADDR`.


## Add a source

`add-source,SOURCE` where `SOURCE` is e.g. "tcp://source.psi.ch:9999".

This lets the repeater maintain a connection to the source.
Messages will be always pulled from the source, even when no outputs are created yet
or none of the outputs has a connected client.


## Remove a source

`remove-source,SOURCE`

Removes the given source as well as all associated outputs.


## Add output to a source

`add-output,SOURCE,OUTPUT`
where `SOURCE` is e.g. "tcp://source.psi.ch:9999"
and `OUTPUT` e.g. "tcp://0.0.0.0:4321".

Creates a PUSH socket on the given `OUTPUT` where clients can connect to.


## Remove output from a source

`remove-output,SOURCE,OUTPUT`


## List configured sources and their outputs

`list-sources`


## Global statistics

`stats`

Reply contains among others: total number of received and send messages and bytes.


## Statistics for a specific source and its outputs

`stats-source,SOURCE`

Reply contains received and sent messages for that source and its outputs, as well as
the current set of channels on that source.


## Exit the repeater

`exit`


# Planned developments

* Provide more detailed statistics on command.
* Gather basic statistics from the bsread messages passing by.
* Detect bsread protocol errors.
* Detect erratic source behavior, like too high event frequency.
* Check for ordering of pulse ids and timestamps.
* Analyze event frequency for each channel.
